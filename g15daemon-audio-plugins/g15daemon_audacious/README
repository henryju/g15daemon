A very simple spectrum analyser and oscilloscoe for audacious.  
Improvements and patches are welcome.

This plugin depends on glib devel and audacious devel packages.

To compile, run the configure script and make, make install.

New in version 1.0pre:
- artist name & track name are displayed
- now a 16 bar analyser, pretty useful :)
- now includes oscilloscope (swap between scope and analyser with L1)
- Playback control with L2-L5 (L2=play/pause, L3=stop, L4=prev, L5=next)
