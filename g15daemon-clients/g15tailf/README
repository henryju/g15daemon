G15tailf is a simple G15Daemon client that outputs the last 6 lines of a
file and writes it's output on the G15's LCD.  It watches the file for
changes and updates automatically.

It works in the same way as the GNU tailf command.

The output can be scrolled horizontally via the rectangular "L" keys
below the LCD.

Options:
There are two options:
-t "Screen Title" displays "Screen Title" at the top of each screen
-d puts g15tailf into the background as a daemon.

g15tailf -t "Message Log" /var/log/messages

Buttons:
L2-L3 - scroll left and right

BUGS:
There are probably plenty.
