A very simple spectrum analyser for xmms.  
Improvements and patches are welcome.

This plugin depends on glib devel and xmms devel packages.

To compile, run the configure script in the g15daemon source directory with
--enable-xmmsplugin and make, make install.

New in version 0.2:
- artist name & track name are displayed
- now a 16 bar analyser, pretty useful :)
- something else I cant recall at the moment..
